Data Centric Development Project

Your Project Name
is a web application which allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes. Using the app the user is able to:

1. View a list of recipes
2. Add a new recipe and add ingredients and method to the recipe
3. Manage static data like categories
4. Edit and delete recipes

UX
This web application has been designed for users who want to manage their recipes easily on an online application, accessible from any device with an internet connection. This has been achieved in my web application as users are able to create, edit and delete recipes in a straightforward and uncomplicated way.

Having interviewed three potential users I was able to gather the following user stories:

As a user I would like this website to search for recipes with a theme for example by Occasions - Christmas, Halloween, birthdays. 
As a user would would like the website to filter by vegiterian, gluten free, egg free etc
As a user would would like  this website to be able to add, edit delete recipes. 
As a user I would like this website to to display images of the of the recipes.
As a user I would to be able to share recipes on social media on this website.
As a user I would like to see if other users like the recipes and have a record count of the likes and dislikes.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.




Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:





Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.






JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.






Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
